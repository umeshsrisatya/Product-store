# MERN Crash Course üöÄ

## About This Application

This project is built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and incorporates **Chakra UI** for building a responsive and modern UI.

### ‚öõÔ∏è Tech Stack:

-   **Frontend**: React.js, Chakra UI, Zustand (for global state management)
-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
-   **Database**: MongoDB
-   **UI**: Chakra UI for a responsive, user-friendly interface
-   **Error Handling**: Proper error handling mechanisms in place
-   **Deployment**: Deployed for easy access to the live version

### üî• Features:

-   **Build an API**: RESTful API with CRUD operations
-   **Responsive UI**: Build with React.js and Chakra UI
-   **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management in both frontend and backend
-   **Deployment**: Deployed to make the app accessible for users

## Setup

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the backend and add the following:

    ```bash
    MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
    PORT=5000
    ```

2. **Run the app locally**:

    To build the frontend for production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Global State Management (Frontend)

-   **Zustand**: I have integrated **Zustand** for global state management in the frontend. You can find the store setup in the file:  
    `frontend/src/store/product.js`. This helps in managing all application states efficiently and makes state sharing across components easy.
